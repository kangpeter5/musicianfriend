
As part of our interview process, we'd like you complete this front-end development assessment. 

Please find the 'developerAssessment.pdf' in this folder.  

It contains a wireframe for a simple layout and instructions on how to complete the exercise. 

Please don't use third-party scripts (with the exception of the core jquery library, included in the js folder) and think about reusable anonymous function coding. Any plugins or modules should be custom code written from scratch.

Please provide a zip file of simple html/js/json/css but note you may need to change the file extension of your zip to .txt to avoid it getting stripped by our firewall. If itâ€™s easier and you have a GitHub account, you can upload it there.

We would like this returned ASAP.
